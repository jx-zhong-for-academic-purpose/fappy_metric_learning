      abstract = {In recent years, deep metric learning has been an end-to-end fashion
    	in computer vision community due to the great success of deep learning.
    	However, existing deep metric learning frameworks are faced with
    	a dilemma about the hard level trade-off for training examples. Namely,
    	the ``harder'' examples we feed to neural networks, the more likely
    	we attain highly discriminative models, but the more easily neural
    	networks get stuck into poor local minimal in practice. To fight
    	against this dilemma, we propose a deep metric learning method with
    	FAlse Positive ProbabilitY (FAPPY) to gradually incorporate different
    	hard levels. Unlike mainstream deep metric learning schemes, the
    	presented approach optimizes similarity probability distribution
    	among training samples, instead of the similarity itself. Experimental
    	results on CUB-200-2011, Stanford Online Products and VehicleID datasets
    	show that our FAPPY method achieves or outperforms state-of-the-art
    	metric learning methods on fine-grained image retrieval and vehicle
    	re-identification tasks. Besides, the presented method has relatively
    	low sensitivity of hyper-parameters and it requires minor changes
    	on traditional classification networks.},
